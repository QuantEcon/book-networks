This textbook is an introduction to economic networks, intended for
students and researchers in the fields of economics and applied
mathematics. The textbook emphasizes quantitative modeling, with the
main underlying tools being graph theory, linear algebra, fixed point
theory and programming. The text is suitable for a one-semester
course, taught either to advanced undergraduate students who are
comfortable with linear algebra or to beginning graduate students.
